Clemensia claims she saw a plasma fruit floating through the walls, but we all know she's just trying to stir up more drama.

Meanwhile, Thaddeus tried to cook a grilled cheese and somehow set the kitchen on fire??? The ghosts are absolutely living for this chaos (pun intended). Vlad would be so disappointed. Or maybe proud? It's hard to tell with him tbh. 💀✨"
